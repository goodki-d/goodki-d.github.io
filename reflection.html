You have all the recipes, yet you choose not to act. Spend more time thinking, holding yourself hostage to your own ideas. Holding some ideas so tight, as if they will be your last or that this is your limit. You can do whatever you set your goal to in whatever timeframe you commit. Holding onto some things so tight, to be too perfect when it's just getting started. When you can complete these things so that you are no longer hostage to your own ideas that might be good from the rest but not the end, for you, for your own self.
